.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mdnsd
.Op Fl hnsv
.Op Fl i Ar IFACE
.Op Fl l Ar LEVEL
.Op Fl t Ar TTL
.Op Ar PATH
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small mDNS-SD daemon for UNIX like systems.  It is based on an
original implementation made by Jeremie Miller in 2003.  Multicast DNS
with service discovery (-SD) is an open standard defined in RFC5762,
mDNS-SD in RFC6763, commonly known to end-users as Bonjour or Avahi,
depending on the operating system.
.Pp
.Nm
reads service definitions of services to announce from
.Pa /etc/mdns.d/*.service ,
a different path may be given on the command line, which can be a
directory or a single service file.
.Pp
.Nm
by default runs on all multicast capable interfaces on a system.  Use
.Fl i Ar IFACE
to only run on a single interface.
.Sh OPTIONS
This program follows the usual UNIX command line syntax. The options are
as follows:
.Bl -tag
.It Fl h
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl i Ar IFACE
Interface to announce services on.  By default
.Nm
runs on all interfaces.
.It Fl l Ar LEVEL
Set log level: none, err, notice (default), info, debug.
.It Fl n
Run in foreground, do not detach from controlling terminal.
.It Fl s
Use syslog even if running in foreground.
.It Fl t Ar TTL
Set TTL of mDNS packets, default: 1 (link-local only).
.It Fl v
Show program version.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/mdns.d/*.service -compact
.It Pa /etc/mdns.d/*.service
mDNS-SD services to announce.
